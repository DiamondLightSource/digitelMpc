# The addition of calc support as a dependency now means that 
# digitelMpc has had to branch to rhel6 and master. This one applies to 
# rhel6 and must only reference calc versions under R3.14.12.3

SUPPORT= /dls_sw/prod/R3.14.12.7/support
CALC=    $(SUPPORT)/calc/3-7

## EPICS_BASE usually appears last so other apps can override stuff:
EPICS_BASE=/dls_sw/epics/R3.14.12.7/base
