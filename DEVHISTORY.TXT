    Application to control an RGA controller via stream device

Release 2_0
PHO 26-7-04 :
   Initial version for EPICS_3_13_9

Pre-requisite:
    Stream device version 1.5 or later must be used.

The Application consists of the following files:
    rga.protocol    - Stream device protocol file
    rga.db          - EPICS database
    rga.edl         - EDM panel
    rga-symbol.edl  - EDM symbol


The example directory has files to show the application in action:
    st.cmd         - VxWorks startup script to initialise an IOC
    rga.sub        - substitution files to instantiate the records
    rga-launch.edl - EDM pannel to launch panels for the RGA
    startgui       - script to start off the user interface

Simulation consists of the equivalent files:
    simulation_st.cmd
    simulation_rga.sub
    simulation_rga.db

    Open sourced to GitHub - altered to build outside DLS
    The above changelist is incorrect - presumably this Ion Pump Module
    was based on an earlier RGA module.
    Changes for external consumption:
    - remove etc and ioc from root Makefile
    - fix 'clean::' issues in Makefiles
    - add RELEASE.local import to RELEASE
    - don't cross compile for vxWorks
    - use python instead of dls-python
    - remove internal CSS screen generator
    - add LICENSE
